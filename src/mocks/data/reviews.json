The story felt disjointed, with plot holes big enough to drive a truck through. The characters lacked depth, making it hard to care about their fates. The gameplay was riddled with bugs and glitches, causing frustration at every turn. Even the graphics, once a highlight of the series, looked dated and uninspired. Overall, this game left me feeling disappointed and disillusioned.",

It's clear that corners were cut in the development process, resulting in a product that feels unfinished and unpolished.",
